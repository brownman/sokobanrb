project goals: 
to build a game framework dedicates for porting an existed game for enother environment.

possible interfaces:
opengl /console / web(rails) 

possible workflow:
the first step will be to MVC-ing your game.
the second step will be to build another interface for it (consider using one of the examples:sokoban, tictactoe , etc.. ).

the benefits:
after one build his game which is most commonly interface with only one environment,
he has the game engine! which is the big fish.

..with some little extra work, he/she should be able to build another interface for it.

- one shouldn't be familiar with opengl for succeeding with building an opengl interface for his/her game - because there will be minor changes to make, when using the built-in framework examples.







opengl?
